description   = A theme is a group of properties that affect the display \
   of all pages that use it -- generally all pages within the system. \
   Themes are very flexible -- you can place in them design elements (such \
   as bullets), colors, copyright notices, font faces, just about anything. \
   The theme also points to the template we use as the main template file, \
   so we can frame the page. The package includes the Theme and \
   ThemeProperty objects as well as the handler used to edit themes. This \
   package is required for the basic operations of OpenInteract.
