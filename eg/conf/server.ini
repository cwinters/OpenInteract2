#  General information about the context of your server

#   request
#      Type of request you can handle. Currently available types are
#      'apache' (if you're running under mod_perl and using
#      Apache::Request), 'cgi' for just about everything else
#      HTTP-related, or 'lwp' if you're running under HTTP::Daemon
#      or any other environment that generates 'HTTP::Request' entries
#   response
#      Type of response you can generate. Currently available types
#      are 'apache' (if you're running under mod_perl and using
#      Apache::Request), 'cgi' for just about everything else
#      HTTP-related, or 'lwp' if you're running under HTTP::Daemon or
#      any other environment that presents you with an
#      HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn (or similar) object which takes an
#      HTTP::Response object to send the response.
#   deployed_under
#      A top-level URL that the server runs under. By default this is
#      blank so the server expects URLs at the top level. If you set
#      this to '/MyOI' for instance, then '/User/search/' is
#      equivalent to '/MyOI/User/search/'. (Note: if you're running
#      under CGI this is automatically set with every request.)
