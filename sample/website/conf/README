sample/website/conf:

This directory holds the OI2-specific server configuration files --
Apache 1.x/2.x and other implementations are held in other 'sample/'
directories. The files here will be copied to $WEBSITE_DIR/conf and
never written again. All changes to those files installed to the
website are manual after installation.

NOTE: If you add a file here be sure to add an entry in FILES so we
know it should be copied over to the website on install.
