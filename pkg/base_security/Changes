      (Replicated fix from 1.x)

2.04  Tue Jul 22 21:56:25 EDT 2003

      Delete script/create_object_security.pl since its functionality

      Updated package docs.

1.59  Tue Jan  7 00:28:20 EST 2003

      Update script/create_object_security.pl to use security objects

      Remove all template/*.meta files

1.57  Thu May  2 01:49:08 EDT 2002

      Add InterBase-specific files (even though we can't use IB for
      both normal + security DB yet)

1.56  Thu Apr 25 09:08:10 EDT 2002

      In OI/Handler/Security.pm: ensure that show() has a valid object
      class to call ->isa() on.

1.55  Tue Apr  2 00:03:59 EST 2002

      Add Oracle-specific info; add a sequence for the security ID for
      both Oracle and Postgres; rename the table filename to match the
      table name.

1.54  Fri Dec 28 10:38:55 EST 2001

      First attempt at factoring out SQL generation so it can be
      called from elsewhere.

1.53  Sun Nov 18 22:42:33 EST 2001

      Modified other templates to use template widgets (where
      appropriate) and other small changes.

1.52  Sun Nov 18 22:17:24 EST 2001

      Modified the class listing template to be more compact and
      understandable.

1.51  Thu Oct 11 10:08:02 EDT 2001

      Updated struct/security.sql to have a longer scope_id field;
      most people won't need to worry about this, but people who use
      LDAP can have long group/usernames as ID values. Existing users
      can remain with their existing structure.

1.50  Fri Sep 28 15:11:37 EDT 2001

      Another duh! (Why does this package give me so many problems?)
      Renamed _cannot_return_msg to _cannot_secure_msg since the
      latter is what we were calling...

1.49  Fri Sep 14 08:31:50 EDT 2001

      Duh! Add SPOPS::Secure to the security handler so it's actually
      protected by security. (Thanks to Andreas Nolte
      <andreas.nolte@bertelsmann.de> for pointing this out.)

1.48  Tue Sep 11 11:48:14 EDT 2001

      Fixed OpenInteract/Security.pm so that if a user does not belong
      to any groups we will not find security info for ALL groups.

1.47  Wed Sep  5 08:56:42 EDT 2001

      Removed the 'hierarchy' action.

1.46  Wed Aug 29 14:05:12 EDT 2001

      Fixed parameter passing mistake in OI/Handler/Security.pm.

1.45  Sat Aug 25 21:32:27 EDT 2001

      Things basically working...

1.44  Sat Aug 25 19:41:35 EDT 2001

1.43  Sat Aug 25 19:33:22 EDT 2001

1.42  Sat Aug 25 17:55:19 EDT 2001

      Ensure that hierarchy editing can be overridden, fix some
      templates.

1.41  Sat Aug 25 17:21:23 EDT 2001

      Remove action item for 'module'

1.40  Sat Aug 25 15:54:10 EDT 2001

      Rewrote security editing code.

1.39  Sat Aug 25 10:52:08 EDT 2001

      Added first draft of multipurpose security listing editor.

1.38  Mon Aug 13 12:12:37 EDT 2001

      Changed all relevant templates to new template format (using OI.blah)

1.37  Sun Aug 12 15:13:14 EDT 2001

      Update script/create_object_security.pl to optionally use
      iterators, be able to specify 'default_objects' keys for the
      scope_id, and more little items.

1.36  Sun Aug 12 11:17:21 EDT 2001

      Modify data/install_security.dat to use new
      'transform_default_to_id' action.

1.35  Sat Aug 11 17:36:51 EDT 2001

      Changed conf/spops.conf->isa from OpenInteract::SPOPS to
      OpenInteract::SPOPS::DBI

1.34  Mon Jul 23 17:05:45 EDT 2001

      Updated to not track object key with each new object saved.

1.33  Mon Jul 16 16:40:27 EDT 2001

      Updated script/create_object_security.pl script to use an
      iterator to fetch the objects and to use prepared insert
      statements to move things along.

1.32  Wed Jun 13 00:34:45 EDT 2001

      Updated table structure so that the UNIQUE key is under 255
      characters. (Thanks to Robert McArthur <mcarthur@dstc.edu.au>
      for pointing out.)

1.31  Mon Jun 11 15:57:36 EDT 2001

      Updated 'script/create_object_security.pl' to only retrieve the
      ID fields of the objects and produce some nicer output. You can
      also pass in a '--where' option and only set security for a
      subset of objects.

1.30  Fri Jun  8 17:50:47 EDT 2001

      Added 'script/create_object_security.pl' to batch-create
      security settings. It's self-contained and will run outside of
      OpenInteract

1.29  Fri Jun  1 11:48:28 EDT 2001

      Fix _build_(group|user)_sql() to return the right structures
      even if there are no users/groups to check.

1.28  Wed May 30 11:54:31 EDT 2001

      Refactor OpenInteract::Security to be easier to understand and
      remove redundant and/or unnecessary code. Also add
      documentation.

1.27  Tue May 29 23:31:36 EDT 2001

      Changed all relevant '$R->scrib( ... )' calls to 
      '$R->DEBUG && $R->scrib( ... )'

1.26  Tue Mar 13 07:20:31 EST 2001

      Changed security level data: 'oid' -> 'object_id'

1.25  Tue Mar 13 00:48:13 EST 2001

      More structure changes (default + not null fun)

1.24  Mon Mar 12 22:48:03 EST 2001

      Renamed the fieldname 'oid' -> 'object_id' to work with
      PostgreSQL. Change made in struct/security.sql, conf/spops.sql,
      OpenInteract/Security.pm (along with changes in SPOPS).

1.23  Tue Mar  6 08:39:11 EST 2001

      Fixed SQL to declare 'scope_id' to be NOT NULL to satisfy the
      UNIQUE requirement.

1.22  Sun Mar  4 16:24:07 EST 2001

      Modified 'OpenInteract::Security' so the code matches the object
      properties.

1.21  Sun Mar  4 16:04:01 EST 2001

      Changed structure of table so that 'level' is
      'security_level'. Changed definition of SPOPS object to
      match. Changed security level data: 'level' -> 'security_level'

1.20  Tue Feb 20 08:05:14 EST 2001

      Modified conf/spops.perl to reflect SPOPS changes.

1.19  Wed Feb  7 07:41:36 EST 2001

      Fixed SQL to declare 'oid' to be NOT NULL to satisfy the UNIQUE
      requirement.

1.18  Wed Jan 31 20:55:42 EST 2001

      Cleanup

1.17  Tue Jan  2 23:27:58 EST 2001

      Added 'hierarchy' action which points to a method in the
      security handler which simply calls a template. Oh, the horror!

1.16  Tue Jan  2 01:19:56 EST 2001

      Fix misspelling in 'conf/action.perl'

1.15  Fri Dec 29 10:47:47 EST 2000

      Add the hierarchy_specify template and the action item
      ('hierarchysecurity') to map to it.

1.14  Wed Dec 20 23:41:22 EST 2000

      Hierarchical security editing works! The template is generally
      working ok (needs some touching up graphically, but we can do
      that later) and the code in OpenInteract/Handler/Security.pm
      works fine as well. Also modified hierarchy security template to
      NOT allow clearing of the ROOT_OBJECT security
      information. Cleaned up conf/spops.perl a little bit along with
      the Handler.

1.13  Tue Dec 19 14:39:30 EST 2000

      Modifications to the 'hierarchy_show' method.

1.12  Tue Dec 19 14:08:01 EST 2000

      Revise widget for displaying hierarchical security and create
      the hierarchy_show method in OpenInteract/Handler/Security to
      fill the template.

1.11  Mon Dec 18 21:57:38 EST 2000

      Create first draft of widget to edit hierarchical security,
      sitting in between the normal security editing widget and the
      object subscribing to the hierarchy security. 

      Extended the 'oid' field to be wider in struct/security.sql.

      Modified the assign_object_security template to use the new
      'isa' template behavior (found in base-1.12+) and to allow an
      object passed in which is not fetched from the database. We
      might need to modify this further to pass in just the class and
      oid so they can be entirely arbitrary.

1.10  Mon Dec 18 16:55:26 EST 2000

      Small changes to OpenInteract::Security, primarily reflecting
      the SPOPS API change to return undef from fetch_by_object() if
      no security information for a particular object is found.

1.09  Mon Dec 11 09:59:27 EST 2000

      Changed the length of the 'class' field to 75 characters. If
      you're not having a problem with the length then you don't need
      to make any changes, but if you have a long website name certain
      security class names can get quite long.

1.08  Nov 16

      Started maintaining Changes file. Renamed method in
      'OpenInteract::Security' to fit with new SPOPS change.
