sample/website/template:

This directory holds all the global templates (a.k.a. 'widgets')
shipped with OI2. When you create a new website they will be copied to
$WEBSITE_DIR/template, and when you upgrade an existing OI2 website
they will also be copied to $WEBSITE_DIR/template, overwriting
existing files unless listed in the '.no_overwrite' file in that
directory.

NOTE: If you add a template here be sure to add an entry in FILES so
we know it should be copied over to the website.
