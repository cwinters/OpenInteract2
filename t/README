README: OpenInteract Test Suite
========================================

One of the aims with the 2.x version of OpenInteract is to have a full
test suite for all available features. To make this happen we need to
have a full working website. Any test script can create one on demand
using 'install_website()' or 'initialize_context()', which creates a
website and installs all SQL data into a SQLite database created on
the fly. (Yes, this means you need SQLite installed to run the tests.)

Since this is a heavyweight operation we try to keep the site around
for all tests by checking the timestamp on a file created in the same
directory as the site. If the timestamp is older than a set amount
(currently 15 minutes) we re-create the site.

In utils.pl are a number of routines to help with testing. You can
initialize a Context object, find a particular file in the test site,
and more.

All files used by tests (e.g., sample configurations, files with known
content types and lengths, etc.) should be in 'use/', which you can
retrieve using:

  get_use_file( $filename, 'file' )
