      Remove just about everything from conf/list_modules.dat

1.59  Tue Aug 21 08:33:40 EDT 2001

      Modify struct/object_track.sql to have the user ID type in it
      rather than the 'increment_type'. (This is to allow for user IDs
      that are character-based, as in LDAP.)

1.58  Mon Aug 20 10:59:59 EDT 2001

      Patch to OpenInteract/Handler/Redirect.pm from Christian Lemburg
      <lemburg@aixonix.de> to use the right 'no template' key when
      redirecting.

1.57  Sat Aug 18 12:42:58 EDT 2001

      Modified the schema for 'object_track' to work with

      Move the 'OpenInteract/Handler/GenericDispatcher.pm' file to the
      core distribution.

      Add 'unique' constraint to struct/object_keys.sql

1.50  Fri Jul 13 10:48:10 EDT 2001

      Moved OpenInteract/SearchManage.pm and
      OpenInteract/SearchIterator.pm to a new package,
      'results_manage'

1.49  Thu Jul 12 12:26:32 EDT 2001

      Added script (script/class_to_object_key.pl) to create an
      object_key for all members in a particular class.

1.48  Wed Jul 11 22:53:26 EDT 2001

      Added new table to match a 32-character key with an object class
      and ID and updated OpenInteract/SQLInstall/Base.pm.

1.47  Tue Jul 10 23:31:51 EDT 2001

      Remove unnecessary stuff from conf/list_module.dat

1.46  Tue Jul 10 22:49:41 EDT 2001

      Shuffled a whole bunch of files from this package into the core
      distribution. They were:

          OpenInteract.pm
          OpenInteract/Auth.pm
          OpenInteract/Cache.pm
          OpenInteract/Cache/File.pm
          OpenInteract/Cache/IPC.pm
          OpenInteract/Cookies.pm
          OpenInteract/Cookies/CGI.pm
          OpenInteract/Cookies/Apache.pm
          OpenInteract/Error/Main.pm
          OpenInteract/Error/System.pm
          OpenInteract/Session.pm
          OpenInteract/Session/DBI.pm
          OpenInteract/Session/MySQL.pm
          OpenInteract/Template.pm
          OpenInteract/Template/Toolkit.pm
          OpenInteract/UI/Main.pm
          OpenInteract/Utility.pm

1.45  Mon Jul  9 10:42:28 EDT 2001

      Added the 'OpenInteract::SearchIterator' class, which iterates
      through search results of mixed classes.

      Also modified OpenInteract/Error/Main.pm to reflect SPOPS API
      change regarding return from ->save().

1.44  Sat Jun 16 20:34:33 EDT 2001

      Added the 'OpenInteract::SearchManage' class, which enables you
      to easily save search results to disk and retrieve them later,
      page through them and retrieve an iterator to grab the objects
      for you.

      Also added the ability for handlers to declare a default level
      of security (using the exported 'DEFAULT_SECURITY_KEY'). Thanks
      to Dave Rolsky for asking about this at YAPC!

1.43  Wed Jun 13 00:55:06 EDT 2001

      Changed the schema of 'object_track' so the primary key fits
      under 255 characters. Also added an 'INSTALL' file warning for
      MySQL 3.22- users. (Thanks to Robert McArthur
      <mcarthur@dstc.edu.au>)

1.42  Thu May 31 21:58:12 EDT 2001

      Changed the relevant ID fields from 'int' to
      '%%INCREMENT_FIELD%%'.

1.41  Tue May 29 23:31:36 EDT 2001

      Changed all relevant '$R->scrib( ... )' calls to 
      '$R->DEBUG && $R->scrib( ... )'

1.40  Wed May 16 22:59:25 EDT 2001

      Added some more documentation information to various modules.

1.39  Mon Mar 26 07:22:01 EST 2001

      OpenInteract.pm: Allow the content type to be set manually when
      sending a file (PDF, CSV, etc.) Most of the time Apache will
      pick up the type properly, but sometimes you need to do it
      manually.

1.38  Mon Mar 19 07:44:52 EST 2001

      Changed the field 'oid' in struct/object_track.sql to
      'object_id' and expanded it.

1.37  Tue Mar 13 07:20:31 EST 2001

      Changed security level data: 'oid' -> 'object_id'

1.36  Sat Mar 10 00:11:01 EST 2001

      Modify OpenInteract/Auth.pm to check to see if the user checked
      the 'Remember me' box in the login form. If not, the expiration
      is undefined and should expire when the browser closes. 

      To use this you will need to set the 'remember_field' of the
      'login' key in your website's conf/server.perl to the name of
      the checkbox in the login form (by default this is
      'login_remember').

1.35  Wed Mar  7 23:56:55 EST 2001

      Modified the 'default' clause in struct/object_track.sql to not
      have 'not null'.

1.34  Wed Mar  7 22:57:12 EST 2001

      - OpenInteract/Session/MySQL.pm: Cleaned up, moved the warning
      message regarding a failure to create a session to the error
      handler

      - OpenInteract/Session/DBI.pm: Fixed to retrieve the right
      parameters regarding the session class and the parameters to
      pass.

      - OpenInteract/Error/System.pm: Fleshed out error handler for
      failure to create session (310).

1.33  Sun Mar  4 16:04:01 EST 2001

      Changed security level data: 'level' -> 'security_level'

1.32  Sun Mar  4 12:26:46 EST 2001

      Added the Cookie processing modules to the conf/list_modules.dat
      file; added debugging to see in the error log which cookie
      processing module is being used.

1.31  Sun Mar  4 11:31:38 EST 2001

      Split out the CGI::Cookie/Apache::Cookie functions into
      OpenInteract/Cookies/CGI.pm and OpenInteract/Cookies/Apache.pm,
      respectively. Calling a method on OpenInteract::Cookies will
      result in an immediate die() being thrown with a message to
      change the config file to use the proper one of these.

1.30  Wed Feb 21 22:23:59 EST 2001

      Added feature to 'date_into_hash()' template function: pass in
      'today' as the second argument and if the first argument (date)
      doesn't exist the system will substitute in today's date.

1.29  Wed Feb 21 06:57:10 EST 2001

      Modified OpenInteract/Session.pm and
      OpenInteract/Session/MySQL.pm in troubleshooting error found
      when a session key is not found in the data store.

1.28  Wed Feb 21 06:28:56 EST 2001

      Modified OpenInteract/Template.pm to work with new package scheme.

1.27  Mon Feb 19 12:38:32 EST 2001

      Updated OpenInteract/Handler/Package.pm to work with new package
      scheme along with template/package_list.tmpl and
      template/package_detail.tmpl.

1.26  Mon Feb 19 00:06:13 EST 2001

      Added Template Toolkit powered by logo to html/images

1.25  Wed Feb  7 00:35:14 EST 2001

      Bugfix! Fixed bug exposed by Wim Kerkhoff <wim@merilus.com> in
      OpenInteract/Auth.pm which didn't take the fact that it had not
      found a user referenced in a session to heart, instead marking
      the user as logged in and trying to fetch groups, etc. Major
      mess -- the user would get 501 errors and not know why.

1.24  Tue Feb  6 17:09:29 EST 2001

      One-line change in OpenInteract.pm which allows you to force the
      content type in $R->{page}->{content_type}

1.23  Tue Feb  6 16:05:08 EST 2001

      Removed default login/password fieldnames from
      OpenInteract/Auth.pm and modified it to throw an error if we
      cannot find any fieldnames. (They should be in the server.perl.)
      Added a new error code to OpenInteract/Error/System --> code 205
      now corresponds to 'cannot_find_login_fields'.

1.22  Fri Feb  2 00:22:55 EST 2001

      Fixed redirect handler

1.21  Thu Feb  1 22:34:05 EST 2001

      New graphics!

1.20  Tue Jan 30 22:04:21 EST 2001

      Cleanup, and lots of it.

1.19  Tue Jan 23 07:13:53 EST 2001

      Did some reformatting of files along with some basic
      cleanup. Removed OpenInteract/Handler/Boxes.pm in favor of the
      base_box package now included with the base distribution.

1.18  Sun Jan 14 23:22:08 EST 2001

      Added call to OpenInteract/Template.pm to track the templates
      used in the current request; also added documentation to this
      file as well as OpenInteract/Template/Toolkit.pm. Modified
      OpenInteract/Auth.pm to add 'logged_in' key to $R->{auth} so you
      can always easily tell whether a user is logged in or not; also
      modified it to get login/password field names from the server
      configuration.

1.17  Tue Jan  2 00:10:14 EST 2001

      Oops -- referred to _send_static_file() in OpenInteract.pm when
      it was mistakenly named _send_static_page(). Fixed the latter.

1.16  Fri Dec 29 19:12:11 EST 2000

      Radically changed how OpenInteract.pm is setup -- instead of
      being a monolithic subroutine 'handler' the 'handler' routine
      calls lots of smaller routines, each of which accomplishes just
      a little. Error checking is greatly simplified and hopefully the
      whole thing is much easier to grasp and follow.

      While it all looks different the functionality is basically the
      same. The only thing changed were the directive processing --
      directives are now kept in the configuration file (server.perl)
      rather than within the handler.

      Modified how the OpenInteract/UI/Main.pm primary conductor --
      added lots of documentation, changed how it specifies template
      names and how it processes directives.

1.15  Fri Dec 29 18:58:01 EST 2000

      Modify how the deal with the directive in OpenInteract.pm -- do
      everything with the URL in _parse_url() (get rid of
      _find_action_from_url()) and if a directive is found eradicate
      it before constructing the $R->{path}->{original}. Modify
      OI/UI/Main.pm to have the right theme template keys (later
      modification will look them up in the config, but for now it's
      too confusing)

1.14  Fri Dec 29 18:40:14 EST 2000

      First batch of changes to modify OpenInteract.pm and
      OI/UI/Main.pm (see notes for v. 1.16 for the scoop).

1.13  Sat Dec 23 01:29:15 EST 2000

      Added lots of documentation to doc/package.pod and
      doc/action.pod.

1.12  Mon Dec 18 22:11:03 EST 2000

      Added behavior 'isa' to OpenInteract/Template/Toolkit to tell
      from a template whether an object has in its ancestry a
      particular class.

1.11  Thu Dec 14 13:53:32 EST 2000

      Added two behaviors to OpenInteract/Template/Toolkit to
      encode/decode HTML from within the template.

1.10  Fri Dec  1 00:38:24 EST 2000

      Fixed (?) package handler so that it should list installed packages ok. 

1.09  Sun Nov 26 11:43:10 EST 2000

      Fixed OpenInteract/UI/Main.pm so that the Popup window template
      will be displayed properly. (Earlier versions not tracked in
      Changelog.)
