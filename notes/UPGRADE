Notes on upgrading from 1.x to 2.0
========================================

 - The 'get_dir()' method from the server config object has been
 removed. The macro references are all resolved at server startup so
 the need for them is gone. Instead of:

   my $dir = $config->get_dir( 'html' );

 You would simply do:

   my $dir = $config->{dir}{html};

 - The 'base' directory in the server configuration is now 'website':

 my $website_dir = CTX->server_config->{dir}{website};


 - Upgrading data files (found in data/):

   transform_default_to_id    --> transform_default
   transform_to_now           --> transform_now
   transform_class_to_website --> NO LONGER NEEDED

 - OI.make_url now takes 'BASE' instead of 'base', and can also take
 'ACTION' and (optionally) 'TASK' to specify the URL.

 - Not that anyone was using it, but the template blocks per package
 'feature' has been eliminated.

 - server config: action_info -> default -> 'conductor' = 'controller'
