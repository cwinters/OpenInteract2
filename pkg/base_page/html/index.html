<h2>Welcome to OpenInteract 2</h2>

<p>OpenInteract 2 is a web application environment written in <a
href="http://www.perl.org/">perl</a>. It runs in several different
environments, the most popular being the <a
href="http://www.apache.org/httpd.html">Apache web server</a>
accompanied by the <a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a>
module.</p>

<p>The environment is built to be not only friendly to people
editing and changing a website's content, but also for the
developers who can write code (or complex templates) and create
entire applications.</p>

<p>Data can be brought into OpenInteract a multitude of ways. You
can use it with most any SQL database that the rock-solid perl <a
href="http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI/">DBI</a>
(Database Interface) module supports -- which is just about
everything! (We have tested so far with 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>,
<a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>, 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> (with caveats), 
<a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/databaseservers/ase/">Sybase ASE</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ianywhere.com/products/sql_anywhere.html">Sybase ASA</a>, and
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/">Microsoft SQL Server</a>. 
InterBase is on the TO DO database list, but someone needs an itch 
to scratch first.) </p>

<p>Out of the box, you can also use LDAP servers for
authentication or data storage. Other types of data sources (CORBA
data sources, XML data, CSV files, etc.) are available by custom
modules -- or if you wait long enough, they'll be in the box
too. Since you have the full power of perl at your fingertips, and
perl is the ultimate glue language, the possibilities are
endless.</p>

<p>This page is currently stored in your filesystem -- but it
could just as easily be in your SQL database. Either way, it looks
and acts like a normal web page to all your users. But to
OpenInteract, it's all data. And you can do anything you can
imagine with it...</p>

<p>This site is a simple working demo of the software. It has a
few tools installed right now, but with the packaging system of
OpenInteract 2, installing new functionality is a snap!</p>
