sample/apache:

The files here are used as templates for Apache 1.x configurations
when creating a new website. They're copied into $WEBSITE_DIR/conf
when creating a new website and then never modified programmatically
again. Further changes to the installed files are all manual and done
by your or your friendly sysadmin.

NOTE: If you add a file here be sure to add an entry in FILES so we
know it should be copied over to the new website when it's created.
