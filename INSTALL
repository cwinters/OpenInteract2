INSTALLING OPENINTERACT 2
=========================

(1) Run the normal perl install

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test (this may take a while...)
 make install

You can also use Module::Build:

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build
 ./Build test
 ./Build install

This procedure will install the base libraries. Normal Perl
installation rules apply.

OI2 comes with a number of files that need to be available for package
authors and people creating websites. You can run:

 $ oi2_manage create_source_dir --source_dir=/opt/OpenInteract2

from the distribution directory to create it.

UPGRADING FROM 1.x?
--------------------

DO NOT WORRY about modules overwriting. Everything is in the
'OpenInteract2::' namespace so your existing 1.x libraries will be
untouched. Also, please read 'perldoc
OpenInteract2::Manual::Conversion' after you install. The short news:
there's no simple conversion for everything, but you'll be gaining
lots of functionality.

DEPENDENCIES
--------------------

OpenInteract2 uses a number of libraries, all of them are readily
available via CPAN. For those on Win32 systems without a compiler,
most of them are also available via the PPM installation system. Some
modules requiring compilation are not available via the standard PPM
repository and are available at:

 http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/

Instructions for setup and download are located there as well.

(2) Create a website

See 'perldoc OpenInteract2::Manual::QuickStart' for instructions on
getting a site running in just a few minutes!

(3) Read up

Check out the documentation, starting with 'OpenInteract2::Manual',
which has pointers to many other documents. Or, after finishing your
website installation you can go to the '/SystemDoc/' path and read the
docs through your browser. In the manual you'll find information about
administering OpenInteract2, notes about packages, what goes into
creating a website, building/configuring Apache, how to create develop
a package, and much more.

Good luck, and have fun!
