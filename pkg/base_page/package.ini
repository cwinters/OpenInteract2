description   = Object and handler representing a static web page, \
  either from the filesystem or from objects stored within a database, \ 
  or both. (Choose the default in 'conf/spops_page.ini'.) This will \ 
  be the default handler for most OpenInteract applications, and is \
  a fundamental part of the system.
