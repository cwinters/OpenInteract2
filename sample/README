What is the sample directory for?
========================================

This directory holds sample files shipped with the OpenInteract2
distribution, used by management tasks to provide initial data for
actions like creating a new website or creating a new package.

You can copy this directory structure, along with the 'pkg/'
directory, from the installation directory to a publicly accessible
location for your users to use. They'll reference the directory as a
'source_dir' when running management tasks. For instance:

 # pwd
 /root/.cpan/build/OpenInteract-2.0
 # mkdir /usr/local/oi2
 # chmod 755 /usr/local/oi2
 # cp -r sample pkg /usr/local/oi2
 # ls -al /usr/local/oi2
 total 12
 drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root         4096 Oct  3 15:07 .
 drwxr-xr-x   12 root     root         4096 Oct  3 15:07 ..
 drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Oct  3 15:07 pkg
 drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Oct  3 15:07 sample

Users creating a package can just do:

 $ cd work/oi2
 $ oi2_manage create_package --package=mypkg --source_dir=/usr/local/oi2

While users creating a new website can execute:

 $ cd /home/httpd
 $ oi2_manage create_website --website_dir=/home/httpd/mysite --source_dir=/usr/local/oi2

Note that you cannot simply copy files from the 'sample/' directory
into their final destination (new website or package). Many of them
are run through a template processor so aspects can be customized for
the website being created -- for instance, there's a sample
configuration file 'sample/website/conf/base.conf' that looks like
this:

  # Base configuration files used in both the httpd.conf and
  # any other scripts/programs that want to setup the framework
  website_dir      [% website_dir %]
  config_type      ini
  config_class     OpenInteract2::Config::IniFile
  config_dir       conf
  package_dir      pkg
  config_file      server.ini
  temp_lib_dir     tmplib

That '[% website_dir %]' gets replaced during the 'create_website'
process by the actual directory in which the website is deployed.
