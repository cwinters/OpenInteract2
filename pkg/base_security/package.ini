description   = Package implementing security in OpenInteract. (Also see \
   SPOPS::Secure, which does the heavy lifting.) Includes the object \
   representing a security status in the system and the methods used \
   for it and handlers to set security on a module/task basis as well \
   as to set security on individual objects. Includes templates that \
   list the various modules and that allow you (as the admin) to set 
   security for various tasks.
