      Change the variables used in 'template/tiny_search.tmpl'

2.53  Sun Jun  6 15:20:38 EDT 2004

2.52  Sun Jun  6 00:26:27 EDT 2004

      Works for me...

2.50  Fri Jun  4 22:48:33 EDT 2004

      implement the relevant pieces.

2.09  Fri Apr  9 08:32:18 EDT 2004

      Update package docs.

1.33  Sun Nov 10 10:18:36 EST 2002

      A configured 'fulltext_pre_index_method' will get called before
      an object is indexed.

      Remove template/*.meta

      Add Oracle-specific table definition.

1.30  Mon Oct 29 09:43:18 EST 2001

      - OI/FullText.pm: don't treat the various methods used in indexing
      as object methods so we can use OI::FullText in 'rules_from'
      rather than 'isa'.

      - OI/FullTextIterator.pm: hardcode (temporary!) the datasource
      name for retrieving object keys

1.29  Mon Oct 29 08:47:06 EST 2001

      Template updates.

1.28  Mon Oct 29 08:18:04 EST 2001

      Enable OpenInteract/FullText.pm to handle scalar refs and
      filehandles as field values.

1.27  Sun Oct  7 16:25:46 EDT 2001

      Added 'Lingua::Stem' and 'DBI' to 'module'.

1.26  Mon Aug 13 12:12:37 EDT 2001

      Changed all relevant templates to new template format (using OI.blah)

1.25  Sun Jul 15 16:56:05 EDT 2001

      Small changes.

1.24  Sun Jul 15 16:42:52 EDT 2001

      Modify OI/Handler/SiteSearch.pm and OI/FullTextIterator.pm based
      on API modifications in OpenInteract::ResultsManage.

1.23  Fri Jul 13 09:06:21 EDT 2001

      Template modifications to use the re-search form and the page
      menu display as BLOCKs.

1.22  Thu Jul 12 22:54:03 EDT 2001

      Small modification to template (don't test .size anymore) and to
      the handler (be sure to request 'raw' results back).

1.21  Thu Jul 12 19:16:12 EDT 2001

      Small changes to both OI/FullText.pm and OI/FullTextIterator.pm,
      plus revise the handler (OI/Handler/SiteSearch.pm) to use the
      new interfaces and information.

1.20  Thu Jul 12 18:06:08 EDT 2001

      Small changes to OpenInteract/FullText.pm and to
      OpenInteract/FullTextIterator.pm so it can handle results
      returned by OpenInteract::ResultsManage.

1.19  Thu Jul 12 15:50:10 EDT 2001

      Refine OpenInteract/FullText.pm

1.18  Thu Jul 12 14:13:32 EDT 2001

      First draft of substantial changes to use a new full_text_index
      table schema (using 'object_key' instead of 'ft_oid') as well as
      using iterators to return search values and a more sensible data
      structure that is accessible to the outside so it can be
      serialized and manipulated without going back to the index.

1.17  Wed Jul 11 19:37:52 EDT 2001

      - Add a template 'no_keywords' to be displayed when the user
      doesn't give any keywords to be searched.

1.16  Sat Jun  9 15:00:55 EDT 2001

      Use the new 'url_edit' property of the hashref returned from the
      template method 'object_info' instead of just adding ';edit=1'
      to the end of the 'url' property. (Static page objects now have
      better URLs -- none of that location=blah stuff -- and the
      previous way was messing them up.) Also add a 're-search' box to
      the search results page.

1.15  Sat Jun  9 14:25:29 EDT 2001

      Updated the 'script/add_objects_to_index.pl' script to batch
      index objects from the command-line. You can now pass a
      '--where' clause in to only do certain objects and you get
      better feedback.

1.14  Wed Jun  6 00:27:01 EDT 2001

      Return the package name from 'ruleset_add' to conform with
      modified SPOPS API.

1.13  Tue Jun  5 09:36:06 EDT 2001

      Create a default column group in OpenInteract/FullText.pm
      ('listing') for use when we fetch each object from the
      information in the index. This way you don't have to retrieve
      the entire object to display a listing of it. (Usable only with
      SPOPS 0.40; earlier versions should just ignore the
      'column_group' argument to 'fetch()')

1.12  Tue May 29 23:31:36 EDT 2001

      Changed all relevant '$R->scrib( ... )' calls to 
      '$R->DEBUG && $R->scrib( ... )'

1.11  Sun Feb  4 17:31:11 EST 2001

      Ensure that 'fulltext_field' conf/spops.perl configuration
      information is consistent throughout docs and code. Make sure
      everything works like it's supposed to.

1.10  Sun Feb  4 14:04:45 EST 2001

      Updated the two command-line scripts found in 'script/' to use
      the new method of setting up an OpenInteract environment and
      (despite their size) commented them so other folks might find
      them useful.

1.09  Wed Jan 31 23:53:12 EST 2001

      Cleanup

1.08  Sat Jan 27 06:31:28 EST 2001

      Modified templates/action table to work with new stuff
