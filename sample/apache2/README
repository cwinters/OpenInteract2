sample/apache2:

The files here are used as templates for Apache 2.x configurations
when creating a new website. They're copied into $WEBSITE_DIR/conf
when creating a new website and then never modified programmatically
again. Further changes to the installed files are all manual and done
by your or your friendly sysadmin.

TODO: Support for Apache2/mod_perl2 may be sketchy. It's a fairly new
addition (2004-Feb) so if you have ideas about how these files or any
of the interfaces (Apache2:: or OI2::Request::Apache2,
OI2::Response::Apache2) please email the openinteract-dev mailing list
or me personally (chris@cwinters.com).

NOTE: If you add a file here be sure to add an entry in FILES so we
know it should be copied over to the new website when it's created.
